# The risk of hospitalization associated with foehn winds and heat in the mountainous region of Switzerland.
author: Tino Schneidewind

This repository presents the main model parametrizations of the analysis, however, the code does not run on its own, because we cannot supply the data here as we are not authorized to do so. 

## Data
The data is not part of this repository but can be applied for using the following procedure. The meteorological data was provided by the [Swiss Federal Office for Meteorology and Climatology](https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/#tab=forecast-map) and is accessable through their own distribution platform [IDAweb](https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/service-und-publikationen/service/wetter-und-klimaprodukte/datenportal-fuer-lehre-und-forschung.html). The hospitalization data was provided by the [Swiss Federal Office for Statistics](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home.html) and the data can be accessed as described on their [webpage](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/erhebungen/ms.html).

## Analysis 
Here we show Models 1 to 4 and demonstrate how we determined the different crossbasis which are described in the paper for our independent analysis and the interaction analysis. 

## Functions
Here we store all our functions needed for the code to run. Both functions were written by Antonio Gasparrini and accessed through [Antonio Gasparrini's GitHub](https://github.com/gasparrini).

## Findings
In these RMarkdown files, we display how the results were visualized. They are subdivided in the corresponding results sections *descriptive statistics*, *the independent effect of foehn winds* and *foehn winds as a modifier of temperature*.
